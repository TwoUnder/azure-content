#  Azure Government Management and Security

##  Key Vault

The following information identifies the Azure Government boundary for Azure Key Vault:

| Regulated/controlled data permitted | Regulated/controlled data not permitted |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| All data encrypted with an Azure Key Vault key may contain Regulated/controlled data. | Azure Key Vault metadata is not permitted to contain export controlled data. This metadata includes all configuration data entered when creating and maintaining your Key Vault.  Do not enter Regulated/controlled data into the following fields: Resource group names, Key Vault names, Subscription name |

Key Vault is generally available in Azure Government. Just as in public, there is no extension, so Key Vault is available through PowerShell and CLI only.
